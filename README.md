# FYP-5-axis-robot
These are the files developed in Yihan LIU's Final Year Project, a 5-axis vision articulated robot
The project is developed into 4 sections
## (1) Mechanical Structure
This includes the CAD files of designed robot, whcih is designed base on BCN3D Moveo.  
CAD file is designed in the SOLIDWORKS.  
The information about BCN3D Moveo could be found in https://github.com/BCN3D/BCN3D-Moveo.  
Joint 1 of Moveo has been redesigned to use a planetary reducer replacing the timing belt, which causes the joint 1 could rotate 360 degrees  
Diagram of planetary reducer could be demonstrated as

Also, there is a fixator designed on the end effector to install depth camera. 
The disgram of designed robot could be shown as

Also, there are some fixators designed to install on each joint to test accuracy of rotational angle of joints, which could be shown as
